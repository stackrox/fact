# fact

## Prerequisites

1. stable rust toolchains.
1. clang and libbpf headers for the C eBPF probe.
1. protoc and the Google protobuf definitions for gRPC.

On Fedora, you can install all the dependencies with the following
commands:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y \
    clang \
    libbpf-devel \
    protobuf-compiler \
    protobuf-devel \
    rustup
rustup toolchain install stable
```

## Build & Run

Use `cargo build`, `cargo check`, etc. as normal. Run your program with:

```shell
cargo run --release --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E"'
```

Cargo build scripts are used to automatically build the eBPF correctly
and include it in the program.

## Running eBPF unit tests

There is some specific unit tests that execute just the eBPF code and
the worker retrieving events from them. In order to run these, root
privileges are required, so a feature is used to exclude them when
running `cargo test`.

In order to run these tests as part of the unit test suite y use the
following command:

```shell
cargo test --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E" --features=bpf-test
```

## Create compile_commands.json

`compile_commands.json` is a compilation database that can be used by
`clangd` to provide better IDE support. This file is particularly useful
for working with the C BPF code in the repository. In order to generate
this file, [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) is recommended, the
following command can be used on x86 machines:

```sh
bear -- clang -target bpf -O2 -g -c -Wall -Werror -D__TARGET_ARCH_x86_64 fact-ebpf/src/bpf/main.c
rm main.o
```

For arm64, replace `-D__TARGET_ARCH_x86_64` with
`-D__TARGET_ARCH_aarch64`.
